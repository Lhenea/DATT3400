# Paragraph

The data I am using is the 2021 Trending Tweets, specifically the August data as it was within the maximum and had a good amount of data inside. The reason I chose this data was because I have been using Twitter a lot more recently, and wanted data that correlated to tweets somehow. I came across the Twitter: Trending Tweets per week data by Rishav Sharma on Kaggle. I decided to use this data as different countries have different trending tabs and thought it would be interesting to use that for the assignment. To access it I needed to download the zip file on the website, which had a csv of the different months inside. After that, I just chose which specific csv data pool I wanted to use. 

I got inspiration for the art from [Steve's Makerplace's video on Perlin Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnSqPzOAmvc&t=80s)
